# BLAZN-Cold-War-Trainer
This is an immensely rough C++ outline for a simple Cold War trainer. If you guys have any advice or ideas for this project, please reply in the UnknownCheats thread. Help me out!

First, there is no guarantee that this code works. To be quite honest, I have not even tested the features out yet. All I know is that this code can successfully attach itself to the game and that by hijacking handles (credit goes to Apxaey), this cheat can essentially go undetected.  And for the offsets (credit goes to JayKoZa)
